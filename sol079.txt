Inspection. Assume each character appears at most once.

Now there's a 319 at the start.
Note that the only thing left of a 3 is a 7, so the first two chars are 73.
Nothing lies between a 3 and a 1, so we have 731.
6, 2 and 8 appear between 1 and 9.
Nothing appears between 1 and 6; between 6 and 2; and between 2 and 8.
The only thing right of a 9 is 0, so the last 2 are 90.
Thus, the passphrase must be 73162890.
